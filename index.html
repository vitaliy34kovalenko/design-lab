					<p>
						Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. <br>
						The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of <br> work. <br>
						Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the <br> pieces you need.
